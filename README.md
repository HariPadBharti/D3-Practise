Possible Questions: -

1.	Which all countries (top five) have maximum inbound students from all around the world and do economy of the region affects the flow of educational destinations?
2.	Do educational reform [increment in literacy] affects economy of the region?
3.	Why education is important for developing countries? Verify by trend of economy and education of the region comparing 10 years of data.

Techniques: - 
1.	Using Choropleth map, drawing distribution of literacy on global scale based on UNESCO data to identify countries having most and the least literacy rate.
2.	Representation of educational investment on world map using Cartograms to identify the current trend of educational reform investments.
3.	Represent the trend of literacy in top 5 developing countries using bar chart to show the interrelation of economic reform and educational reform. 

Findings and validation of results can be concluded from the visualization found that can showcase major trends of education and economy on global scale. Taking gravity and significance of literacy and education on global scale, this project can be useful to explore hidden trends and co-relation of different aspects of world education and related implications.
